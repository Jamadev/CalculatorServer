# CalculatorServer

How it works:

1. Open visual studio and clone this solution from Github.

2. Compile and run the solution.

3. A console and a web application will open.

On the web application you will see a simple Swagger UI that allows you to review the HTTP methods and test them. 
It shows the input structure and the expected output for each method.

The console is the calculator's client, you can interact with it and make the intended calculations.

There is a folder profile created in the application to build the application's dlls. 
You can use the contents of this folder to deploy it to IIS.

For running the application you need to have installed .NET Core SDK and runtime version 2.1. or superior.

In case of doubt, don't hesitate to contact me.
